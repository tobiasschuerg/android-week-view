# Migration Compose WeekView

## Introduction

This migration plan documents the step-by-step process of converting the existing view-based Android
WeekView library to Jetpack Compose. The goal is to provide a modern, maintainable, and flexible
week view component for Android applications, supporting both the classic view-based implementation
and the new Compose-based approach during the transition. Each step is tracked for progress and
stability, with continuous rules to ensure code quality and maintainability throughout the
migration.

## Steps and Status

1. Analyze the existing view-based WeekView architecture [✔]
2. Create the Compose package and base structure [✔]
3. Implement the background grid in Compose [✔]
4. Integrate into the sample app with chooser for Classic and Compose [✔]
5. Refactor to use separate activities for Classic and Compose [✔]
6. Correct label positioning in the grid [✔]
7. Fix label positioning issues (boxSize, Dp conversion) [✔]
8. Clean up code quality issues and implement proper component separation [✔]
9. Fine-tune the UI (proper margins, label positioning) [✔]
10. Implement event rendering in Compose [open]
11. Add interactions (click, context menu, scaling) in Compose [open]
12. Testing and validation [open]
13. Documentation and README update [open]

## Continuous Rules

- After each step, ensure a stable state for a git commit
- Comments in code must be in English
- Put components into their own files, avoid large files
- Extend and modify this plan whenever needed to reflect new requirements or findings

## Legend

- [✔] done

## Recent Completed Work (Step 9)

### UI Layout Improvements

- **Fixed margin handling**: Time labels now appear in dedicated 48dp left margin instead of overlapping first column
- **Proper grid boundaries**: Canvas drawing starts from margin offsets, not screen edges
- **Classic layout parity**: Compose implementation now matches the visual structure of the classic view
- **Label positioning**: Day labels in 32dp top margin, time labels in left margin with proper centering

### Technical Fixes

- All compilation errors resolved
- Proper parameter passing to WeekLabels component
- Margin calculations correctly applied to all grid elements (lines, highlights, indicators)

---

The Compose week view now has a professional layout with proper label positioning that matches the classic implementation. Ready to proceed with event rendering implementation.

Please update this plan after every step to keep progress transparent.
